Things that changed after the first report:
- device list, connections list and monitor list fixed to keep LL(1) sturcture
- no .o for output; need to add a semantic error if a dtype before the arrow is missing an output name
- semantic error for device names matching keywords
- remove 'state', 'inputs' and 'cycles' keywords
- constraint for at least to charachters in the name is removed
